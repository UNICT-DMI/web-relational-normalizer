<p>
This application has been developed for students of Normalization Theory
who want to check their solution to tests and exercises.
</p>
<p>
The author and current maintainer of this application is <a
href="http://www.dsi.unive.it/~orsini/">Renzo Orsini </a>, at University Caâ€™ Foscari of Venice, which is
in debt with <a href="http://www.di.unipi.it/~albano/"> Antonio
Albano</a>, at University of Pisa,
 for many suggestions aimed at improving the usability and
functionalities of the system, as well as for testing the application.
</p>
<p>
The system is inspired to a previous normalizer written in Java by
Giacomo del Rio, when he was student at the University of Pisa.
